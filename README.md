# Iris Dataset Exploration and Visualization

This project focuses on exploring the Iris dataset using Python, performing data cleaning, generating descriptive statistics, and visualizing data distributions and relationships to gain meaningful insights.

## Features
### Data Exploration
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn`.
- Converted the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Checked for missing values and generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

### Data Visualization
- Created histograms for feature distributions.
- Used pairplots to visualize relationships between features by species.
- Generated boxplots and scatter plots to identify trends and outliers.
- Built a correlation heatmap to analyze feature interdependencies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation and visualization.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `sklearn` for loading the Iris dataset.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/iris-dataset-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3.Run the iris_analysis.py script.

## Output
The project generates:
- Statistical summaries of the dataset.
- Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, pairplots, and boxplots.
- A heatmap to analyze feature correlations.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is sourced from the `sklearn` library, containing 150 observations with 4 features:
- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The target variable (**Species**) has three classes:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**
